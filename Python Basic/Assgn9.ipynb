    "Ans: The relative path is the path to some file with respect to your current working directory (PWD).\n",

    "‘a’ – Append Mode: With this mode the user can append the data without overwriting any already existing data in the file.\n",
    "‘a+’ – Append and Read Mode: In this mode you can read and append the data without overwriting the original file.\n",

    "\n",
    "whereas the readline() that will read and print out only the first characters that take up as many bytes as we specify in the parenthesis. We may want to use readline() when we are reading files that are too big for our RAM.\n",

    "The readline() function, on the other hand, only reads a single line of the file. This means that if the first line of the file were three lines long, the readline() function would only parse (or iterate/operate) on the first line of the file."
